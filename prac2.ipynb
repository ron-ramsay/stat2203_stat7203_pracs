    "For example, although the probability of an even number for the first draw will remain at $\\frac{50}{100}$, probabilities for the second draw are dependent on the first, e.g. if the first draw is even, then the probability of even in the second draw is $\\frac{49}{99}$, whereas the probability of odd in the second draw is $\\frac{50}{99}$. There are a different sequence of such fractions for each of the 10 permutations (of 3 even and 2 odd draws), but it can be shown (if one posessed skill and stamina) that the product of all 5 fractions for any of the 10 permutations is equal to $\\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 50 \\times 49}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times 97 \\times 96}$.
