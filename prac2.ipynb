There are a different sequence of such fractions for each of the 10 permutations (of 3 even and 2 odd draws), but it can be shown (if one posessed skill and stamina) that the product of all 5 fractions for any of the 10 permutations is equal to $\\frac{50 \\times 49 \\times 48 \\times 50 \\times 49}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times 97 \\times 96}$.
